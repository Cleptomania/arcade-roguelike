# Introduction

## Overview

This tutorial is inspired by the famous [complete roguelike tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/) which uses the [tcod](https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to build a Roguelike. This version has been adapted to use the [Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy) game engine instead.

This is a big difference in library used, so a lot of the setup and code will look very different. However, the general flow and progression of the tutorial has been setup to mirror that of the original tutorial, however there are a lot of extra pieces that are specific to teaching things about Arcade.

This tutorial assumes you have zero knowledge of Arcade, but are at least relatively familiar with Python(specifically, version 3.6+). You should also be familiar with object oriented programming in Python, as it used heavily throughout the tutorial.

Currently this version is written to support Arcade version 2.6 or higher. A significant portion of the code presented here will not run with versions of Arcade previous to that.
